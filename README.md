# Sentiment-Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook performs text sentiment analysis (likely on social media/tweet data) to classify emotions as positive, negative, or neutral.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (lowercasing, removing URLs/special characters)

Tokenization & stopword removal using libraries like NLTK

Model Building:

Common algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or RNN/LSTM for deep learning

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices

Visualization:

Word clouds for frequent terms

Bar plots showing sentiment distribution

Technical Stack
Python libraries: pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Dataset: Likely uses a standard corpus (e.g., Twitter data, IMDb reviews)

Challenges Addressed
Handling slang/abbreviations in informal text

Managing imbalanced class distributions

Note: The code isn‚Äôt fully viewable due to GitHub rendering issues, but this analysis reflects standard sentiment analysis workflows. For specific implementation details, direct code access or screenshots would be needed.
